This was a very good problem. I even setup tables with the given data and tried out querying step by step.

My solution:
SELECT f1.X,f1.Y FROM Functions as f1
WHERE f1.X = f1.Y
GROUP BY f1.X, f1.Y HAVING COUNT(*)>1

UNION

SELECT f1.X,f1.Y FROM Functions as f1, Functions as f2
WHERE f1.X <> f1.Y AND f1.X = f2.y AND f1.Y = f2.X AND f1.X < f2.X
ORDER BY X;
