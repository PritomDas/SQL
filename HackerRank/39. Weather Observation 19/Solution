/* My observations
Same approach as my previous solution
The last problem used Manhattan Distance Metric but for this we are going to use Euclidean Distance Metric
*/

/*
#use SQRT to find square root
#use MIN and MAX to find smallest and largest values
#use POW to square of the number by passing 2nd prameter as 2
#use the ROUND to round of decimal numbers
#Euclidean Distance formula looks like: 
If the points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are in 2-dimensional space, then the Euclidean distance between them is √(x2−x1)^2+(y2−y1)^2
