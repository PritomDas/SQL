solution 1:
#using nested queries and NOT IN clause approach

SELECT Name AS "Customers" FROM Customers
WHERE Id NOT IN ( SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);





Solution 2:
#using the concept of left outer join, I have also attached a video material to understand about it
SELECT C.Name as "Customers" FROM Customers as C
LEFT JOIN Orders as O
ON C.ID = O.CustomerId
WHERE O.CustomerId is NULL;
